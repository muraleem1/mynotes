Taurus : Ganesha foresees that this week is going to be very taxing for you, and you will really have to pull up your socks to cope up with the ever-increasing workload in your office, as well as the demands of your family members. Brace up for a rough ride all-round, be positive, take one thing at a time and try to flow with the tide, because resistance is only going to prove to be futile. Also, don't dismiss suggestions from other people out of hand; instead, take them seriously, ponder over them and see if you can really implement them. If they come from well-wishers, you would do well to heed their suggestions, for they will only have a positive bearing on your circumstances. Your creativity is likely to come to the fore, so make the best use of it. On the financial front, budget your expenses carefully.
